# Notification Script
This is a python script that connects to your telegram account, reads every message you receive and if it contains some keywords forwards it to a specific channel.

## How does it work?
If telethon sends a message, through your own account, you wouldn't get any push notification. 
A bot can solve this problem by sending an alert to the channel. Furthermore it helps to edit the keywords list.

## Hosting
The script is hosted on Reply.it for free (thanks to uptimerobot.com).
